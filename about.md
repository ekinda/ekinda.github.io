"I'm a sixth year medical student and I'm interested in a wide variety of subjects such as systems biology of cancer, mathematics, early modern European history -especially Spain, HRE and the Low Countries-, sci-fi and fantasy books, the chemistry of cooking and baking desserts, video game modding, etc. I am planning to focus on three main areas in this blog: European history, social determinants of health and the importance of social science education in STEM fields." </p>
