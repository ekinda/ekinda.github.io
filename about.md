I'm a medical doctor from Turkey and currently I am doing a PhD in bioinformatics at the Max Planck Institute for Moleular Genetics in Berlin. I'm interested in a wide variety of subjects such as evolution, mathematics, history and sociology (especially of early modern Europe), Marxism, sci-fi and fantasy books, the chemistry of cooking and baking desserts, photography etc. My research interests are transcriptional regulation and evolution of the non-coding genome.</p>
